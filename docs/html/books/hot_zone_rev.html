                        The Hot Zone explores the history of Ebola and its related viruses. The author establishes the
                        origins of
                        Ebola with anecdotes of people's experiences dealing with the virus while adding some medical
                        facts
                        where more elaboration is needed. The anecdotes keep you drawn to the book, and give you
                        knowledge about Ebola through stories and personal accounts. I think the author did a great job
                        giving
                        the general public an idea about how viruses are dealt with, and how the research is done. I
                        would
                        recommend this book to everyone, it doesn't require any prerequisite knowledge of medical
                        science,
                        and it weaves the history of Ebola in a thrilling and adventurous way.
                        The book started with the story of Charles Monet(a worker at an African sugar factory), and his
                        experience with Marburg, a virus that is related to Ebola. I thought this was interesting
                        because most
                        books give a background before the story begins, but this book jumped straight to the point.
                        Throughout the book, this fast-paced ness never slowed. That is what made the book such a
                        thrill, new
                        events were unfolding every page, making me want to read on and on. If Richard Preston, the
                        author,
                        didn’t include people's thoughts and opinions, the story of Ebola wouldn’t have such a large
                        emotional
                        effect on the readers.
                        After discussing Monet’s encounter with Marburg, Preston discusses the several ways that Monet
                        could have gotten this virus. He specifically mentions the Kitum cave in Kenya. Preston
                        describes this
                        cave with so much detail, giving me a crystal clear image of how Monet may have contracted the
                        virus
                        in the cave.
                        It turns out that Preston had such a passion for learning about Ebola that he decided to take a
                        trip
                        to the cave and explore what lived inside. He talked to many Africans and visited the places
                        Monet had
                        been allowing Preston to describe all the events with such accuracy. Preston also interview
                        almost
                        every person he mentioned and included all their thoughts allowing for a very accurate and
                        emotional
                        book. Preston also refrained from adding his opinions unless he was talking about his own
                        experiences
                        with the virus. This helps the readers get a genuine perspective of what the virus was like
                        without
                        anything to skew what the people involved felt.
                        After Preston explored the effects of ebola and its relatives in Africa, he shifted to the
                        repercussions of the virus in America. Preston started exploring how the army analyzed the
                        viruses(blood from the Ebola patients were sent to the army). Colonel Nancy Jaax was one of the
                        people to work with Ebola. The army injected Ebola into monkeys to see what Ebola did
                        internally.
                        Nancy Jaax felt that it was wrong to give animals a virus and allow them to be killed, but she
                        believed
                        this was the only way to help humans. Nancy had a very strong love for animals and believed that
                        humans shouldn't control them as much as they do. Nancy's statements resonated with me. I
                        started
                        to wonder, what if humans didn't interfere as much in the lives of animals, would anything
                        change?
                        Later in the book, I realized that a mass monkey causality could have been avoided if humans
                        didn't purchase monkeys from other countries and cram them in small spaces. An American company
                        was buying monkeys from the Philippines, and distributing them to others for animal testing.
                        During
                        one of these importations, some of the monkeys started to get very sick and die, and this soon
                        started
                        to spread to other monkeys. The scientists thought it was Ebola and were scared that this could
                        become detrimental for humans. The Army decided to wipe out all the monkeys and decon the
                        building. Luckily, this virus was unable to affect humans. But, there could have easily been a
                        virus that
                        would kill humans very easily, and forcing animals into cages only amplifies the possibilities
                        of viruses.
                        I think we need to remember that animals are also living beings, and they need to be treated
                        with
                        respect. These animals should be able to live in the wild, and should not be captured for human
                        benefit. Practices such as animal testing need to stop, once these stop the demand for animals
                        will
                        decrease ultimately helping both human and animal populations.
                        After this incident, the United decided to ban the importation of animals for testing, and after
                        the
                        ban was lifted the importations slowed. Although this is a step in the correct direction, I
                        think there
                        needs to be a greater awareness regarding the lives of animals, and how they should be
                        respected.
                        These ideas also need to spread throughout the world, there are some countries where a large
                        amount
                        of their money stems from the sales of the native animals. As a joint force, we have to spread
                        awareness throughout the world what the mishandling of animals can result in.
