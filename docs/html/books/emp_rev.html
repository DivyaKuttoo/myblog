                        This book details the history of cancer/ cancer research, and its treatments from 1600 B.C. to
                        the
                        present day. One of the most interesting things about this book is that anyone can understand
                        it.
                        Despite being a scientific book, there is no complex math involved and important theories are
                        introduced and explained in lay person’s terms. Before reading this book I did not have much
                        knowledge about oncology, or leukemia, both of which Mukherjee details throughout the book.
                        Nevertheless, I fully understood the gist of the theories underpinning and scientific basis that
                        Mukherjee has mentioned. I would recommend that anyone going into or interested in the medical
                        field
                        should read this book at least once. Although this is a medical book, I believe that anyone
                        interested in
                        gaining insight about cancer should read this book as well. I had previously only heard of
                        cancer, and
                        its cruelty, this book gave me a lot of insight into the hard work of scientists to cure cancer.
                        The way this book is written is unlike traditional medical books, Mukherjee has a great command
                        of
                        literature, and this enhances the book by urging readers to not only understand the effects of
                        cancer
                        medically but also emotionally. Every chapter begins with an epigraph, which gives the reader an
                        idea
                        to ponder while reading the chapter. Mukherjee also quotes researchers at the beginning of every
                        chapter throughout the book giving a glimpse into the work of others, and sharing different
                        views of
                        cancer.
                        Mukherjee researched the work of many scientists, and their work on cancer, Dr. Sidney Farber,
                        and his work was the most intriguing to me. Dr. Farber was a pathologist at a children’s
                        hospital; every
                        day he would see children disclosed from the world, in the back of hospitals because they had
                        leukemia, but no doctors were trying to cure them. During that time doctors viewed leukemia as
                        “an
                        orphan disease, abandoned by internists”(Mukherjee, pg.27). And politically/socially, there was
                        no
                        widespread knowledge of cancer. For that reason, Dr. Farber was determined to eradicate
                        leukemia.
                        Dr. Farber didn’t follow widely held conventions or beliefs, he worked hard to find a cure for
                        leukemia
                        so he can save lives. I think this attitude is the basis of innovation if you are
                        self-determined there is no
                        limit for what you can achieve. Today, Dr. Farber is known as the father of chemotherapy, and I
                        truly
                        believe if he didn’t challenge societal norms, he would have never been able to save as many
                        lives as
                        he did.
                        Luckily, in the mid-1900s, Mary Lasker was able to raise awareness of cancer. As advertising
                        became more popular/prominent it ushered in new views of cancer. Lasker showed the world that
                        cancer “can be cruel but it does not need to be fatal”(Mary Lasker). With Lasker’s help, the
                        cancer
                        society was revived. The donations cancer corporations received were greatly increased with
                        newfound awareness. Lasker’s work completely opened my eyes to how to cure diseases. I always
                        thought that the only way that the human race could destroy illnesses, such as cancer, would be
                        with
                        tons of research and lots of trials. Lasker had a very different background than the other
                        scientists, she
                        was an art dealer, but she helped the cancer cause just as much as the doctors. This made me
                        realize
                        that it is important to appreciate and understand different views that can work together to find
                        a
                        solution. Lasker also represents just how much the media can dictate peoples’ actions; so
                        everyone
                        must do their part to raise awareness about things that matter to them because public support
                        could
                        change a lot. While the media had a large role in helping find cures for cancer, it also
                        marketed items
                        such as cigarettes which cause lung cancer.
                        Advertising was at a peak around WW2, a popular symbol of women helping the war was Rosie the
                        Riveter. Rosie urged American women to break traditional roles and help the war effort. But soon
                        Rosie
                        the Riveter morphed into a symbol for smoking also. Rosie’s image appeared throughout the
                        country
                        and she had a stone face filled with calmness and determination. Cigarette companies attributed
                        this
                        to her smoking habits, luring women to start smoking. In the case of smoking-related cancer,
                        prevention is the cure. If people stopped smoking, instances of lung cancer would be largely
                        reduced.
                        But smokers quickly became addicted and need to smoke to relieve stress. Lawyers started to sue
                        cigarette companies claiming they were putting their consumers in harm's way, but cigarette
                        companies were very powerful and these lawsuits barely dented their thriving businesses. On top
                        of
                        the failed lawsuits, many people were reluctant to admit that smoking did indeed cause cancer.
                        Today,
                        the concept that smoking is terrible for your lungs is widely known, and more PSAs are warning
                        against

                        it. Also, schools are teaching children to never smoke in the future, education like this is the
                        step in the
                        right direction. If schools stop new generations from smoking, lung cancer will be largely
                        prevented.
                        Although cigarette-related illnesses are still happening right now, with the right education, I
                        think there
                        is hope for the future.
                        Cancer was influenced by social marketing in the form of cigarettes, but a cure for cancer also
                        relies on political involvement. In 1969, the New York Times published attesting that former
                        President
                        Nixon had “it in [his] power to begin to end [cancer]” (New York Times, Dec. 12, 1969). It was a
                        newfound belief that society could cure cancer, but the only thing holding it back was funding.
                        Unlike
                        the past, cancer fell “into the full glare of public scrutiny”(Mukherjee, pg. 181). I think a
                        large political
                        and social awareness of cancer arose because the illness was starting to become more prominent.
                        In
                        the 1900s, technology, and medicine improved with the introduction of hygiene and cures to
                        illnesses
                        such as tuberculosis, causing the average life expectancy of the population to rise. Cancer,
                        which is
                        more probable with age starts to manifest in the older populations. With more bills being passed
                        in
                        congress for cancer research, a greater knowledge of cancer is bound to be reached in the
                        future.
                        Besides the history of cancer and research, Mukherjee includes his own experiences dealing with
                        cancer patients. Mukherjee is an oncologist, so he mainly deals with leukemia. He seamlessly
                        includes
                        his thoughts while he treats patients, his thoughts always seem raw, and I never get the idea
                        that he is
                        trying to hide anything or sugar coat thoughts. Mukherjee highlights that doctors deal with a
                        mental
                        turmoil of sorts, he explains that when he was on his way to a bone marrow biopsy, he “felt a
                        certain
                        dread descend on me, a heaviness that bordered on sympathy but never quite achieved it”. with
                        this,
                        Mukherjee allows the public to see cancer from the side of the patient and the side of the
                        doctor.
                        Mukherjee wants the general public to understand exactly what cancer is medically, but he
                        ensures
                        that he doesn’t leave out the emotional element felt by all doctors and patients. Although some
                        of
                        Mukherjee’s depictions of patients were very vivid and difficult to read, I don’t think the book
                        would be
                        the same without those aspects. Without drawing out emotions I don’t think Mukherjee could have
                        instilled the passion for medicine or science as well as he did. And all in all, this book
                        helped rid me of
                        some misconceptions of cancer and taught me a lot about how cancer and its research changed
                        throughout time.
                        Before reading this book I was afraid that it would be filled with sadness and hopelessness, but
                        that
                        was not true. There are times where the book evokes a sense of sadness by portraying deaths, but
                        I
                        feel that this book is more of an inspiration. It shows that cancer can be dethroned and that
                        humans
                        have come such a long way in cancer treatment, and more could be discovered in the future.
                        Towards
                        the end, Mukherjee explains that maybe cancer can’t fully be eradicated, but he still has hope
                        that
                        technology can drive it close to extinction. He instills this hope by explaining the view he has
                        for the
                        future of cancer treatment, he thinks that “treatment can be stretched out longer and longer” so
                        that
                        cancer can slowly dwindle (Mukherjee, pg.462).
