                        Double Helix is a scientific memoir written by James Watson, who won a Nobel Prize in 1962
                        for his work with DNA which is highlighted in this book. This book comes from Watson’s
                        perspective which led to tinged of bias. Watson’s character seemed harsh from his portrayal of
                        Rosalind Franklin, but he did concede(in the epilogue) to the fact that she was treated
                        unfairly.
                        Overall, this book provided a glimpse into the “race” to discover the structure of DNA. Although
                        Watson’s descriptions seemed to bash others, such as Rosalind Franklin, it gives valuable
                        insight
                        into the politics and clashes in the scientific world.
                        One specific event that struck me as extremely odd, and in my opinion deteriorated the
                        character of Watson was when Watson listened to a speech given by Rosalind Franklin and
                        decided that he didn't need to take notes because he could recall everything from memory.
                        Franklin was lecturing on groundbreaking ideas in the DNA world, and since Watson was
                        researching this field it was important that he take notes on her speech. I think if Watson had
                        just
                        acknowledged that he made a mistake by not noting Franklin's speech, then his honesty would
                        be admirable. Instead, Watson chose to tell Crick incorrect facts from Franklin's speech because
                        he had forgotten the specifics. This event reminded me that you can learn something from
                        anyone and everyone. It is important to remember that nobody is perfect and there is always
                        room for improvement. Life is filled with endless learning possibilities, and pride should not
                        stop
                        anyone from pursuing these possibilities.
                        Another event that I found interesting was that all the scientists that were working to find the
                        structure of DNA were rivals. I assumed that everyone would share their research with their
                        colleagues to discover the structure of DNA sooner. But after reading Double Helix, I can see
                        that
                        they treated one another as competitors. I understand why the scientists each wanted to
                        accomplish this themselves, but I think there is still a need to stay ethical and true to the
                        scientific field. When Peter Pauling approached Watson and Crick and told them his father, Linus
                        Pauling, would publish a paper about DNA (most of the mystery regarding DNA was solved in
                        this paper), Watson and Crick noticed a major, but an easily fixable mistake, but they didn't
                        warn
                        him. In fact, they urged him to publish the paper. At this point, these scientists had all
                        worked
                        very hard on DNA research, and this became more than just rivalries between colleges/countries.
                        I believe that Watson and Crick should've put aside their competitive attitudes and helped a
                        colleague.
                        It is also important to note that this book depicts the scientific community in the 1950s.
                        During this time, women were expected to either stay home or have traditionally female jobs
                        such as telephone operators and secretary positions. Though Watson’s portrayal, it is obvious
                        that Rosalind Franklin wasn’t treated the same as others. In fact, one of Watson’s close friends
                        stole her research and gave it to Watson. In the epilogue, Watson mentions that he now knows
                        his behavior towards Franklin was wrong, and he alleges that she was a brilliant scientist. It
                        was
                        very mature of Watson to admit he wronged Franklin, but I think books like this are essential to
                        see how scientific research has evolved.
                        All in all, this book gave an unfiltered view of scientific research through Watson’s eyes; And
                        explains how a trailblazing scientific discovery was made. And although reading it in current
                        times highlights the difficult research nature of the past, it is obvious Watson is not
                        sugar-coating
                        any instances, and all events seem raw and honest.
