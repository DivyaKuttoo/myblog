                        A Brief History of Time is extremely famous book, selling millions of copies throughout the world.
                        Before I read this book I had heard of Stephen Hawking and his influential work in cosmology. This
                        book details everything from theories about black holes to the possibility of time travel. For this reason,
                        I assumed the book would be really difficult to read, and didn’t read it until a few years after I bought it.
                        Then, one day I heard someone say that despite millions of copies being sold, very few people actually
                        read A Brief History of Time. After hearing this I thought that I should try and read the book because I
                        had just taken AP physics 1 and 2. Although some concepts were difficult to fully understand, I think
                        after reading it for a second time, most concepts became clearer. This book was written for lay persons
                        to educate the general public in cosmology. On this account Stephen Hawking more than achieved his
                        goal.
                        Another interesting characteristic of the book is its concision. A lot of scientific books explain
                        concepts with an array of different research publications, but this book is different. Hawking was able
                        to explain every concept with a few sentences. Additionally, I felt that there were no extraneous details
                        scattered around the book. Every word used was significant in this book, and nothing ever strayed
                        from the main focus of the chapters. Hawking’s writing style made this book very easy for me to read.
                        While reading the book for the second time, I appreciated how he made all of the chapters follow a
                        sequential order. He began with Galileo and Ptolemy's views of the Earth and managed to end with
                        time travel and wormholes. I still wonder how he covered so much material in such a small book. The
                        sequential order helped me see how one discovery led to another. It reminded me that even though
                        only a handful of scientists are commonly known for their work in cosmology, there were thousands of
                        scientists working to help give us the knowledge that we have today.
                        I found the chapter about time travel and wormholes the most interesting. My perception that
                        ideas such as these were only in the realm of sci-fi movies. Before reading this chapter I assumed that
                        Hawking was going to refute the ideas that commonly showed up in sci-fi movies, but instead,
                        Hawking discussed the scientific advances that make time travel viable some day. For example,
                        Hawking describes different ways that space-time could be warped to allow for time travel. Hawking
                        also mentions that the book The Time Machine by H.G. Wells, which pondered how time travel could
                        become attainable.
                        A Brief History of Time was published in 1988, so after reading this book, I was curious if any
                        advancement in time travel had been found. Turns out, in 1992 Hawking himself had written a paper
                        about time travel; he asserted that negative energy was needed to build a time machine, but we were
                        surrounded by positive energy. But despite this, time travel could be possible in regions with exotic
                        matter, which are particles that don’t follow the laws of physics, like particles that have a negative
                        mass. Exotic mass is currently only theoretical, so I assumed there had not been much more of an
                        advancement in time travel. But then I read that a few months ago(January 2020), Ronald Mallet found
                        a theoretical way to create a time machine, his idea still had a few flaws but is such a large
                        advancement for cosmology.
                        I looked further in Ronald Mallet’s work to see if he had tried to build or change aspects of his time
                        machine. First I read about his early life and found out that he started a career in cosmology because
                        his father died when Mallet was 10 years old, and he became determined to save his father by
                        reversing time after reading The Time Machine. Ever since Mallet was a kid he was immensely
                        passionate about cosmology, and he has achieved so much since then. He even believes that a time
                        machine could be built in the next 10 years. As of right now, Mallet is working out more mechanics for
                        his time machine. The belief that a time machine could be invented shortly really shows how far
                        science and technology have come, and how much more understanding the human race could have
                        about space and time.
                        Overall, this book not only gave me a general view of the universe/multiverse, but it pushed me to
                        think about futuristic possibilities. This book had just the right amount of information to make people
                        aware of cosmology, but yet still ignites one’s curiosity. I think everyone, no matter their interests
                        should read this book. Even if you are not a fan of science, this book will keep you interested. Also, this
                        book has so much information, it may take more than one read to soak it all up. After reading it the first
                        
                        time and understanding all the main points, the second time allows you to focus on The more complex
                        concepts and also pushes you to think more about every sentence he writes.
