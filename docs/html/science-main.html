            I started this blog to share some of the things that inspired me during high school. When I was in middle
            school I starting learning sitar. At first it was just a hobby for me, but then I realized how deep and
            soulful the music is. Around the beginning of high school I gained a large passion for sitar and thought I
            would share some of the pieces I worked on.
            In addition to sitar, I also want to add my thoughts on some books that have inspired me, and that have
            fueled my passion for science.This blog will also contain some ideas that I find interesting, or events that
            I want to share.
            This is a unique blog for you to explore. I love having the opportunity to share my passions and thoughts.
            This blog will include sitar music, inspirational books, and much more. Read on, and enjoy...
