            This blog explores everything from books to music. I hope to help others garner an appreciation for
            classical music by sharing videos of both myself and classical mastersI also wanted to share my thoughts on
            scientific books that inspired me to not only pursue my passions, but to also find a way to genuinely help
            others. There will also be simple at-home science experiments with steps and explanations. Lastly, this blog
            will also include breakthrough historical events in scientific fields and how these events inspired the life
            we live today.
            Read on, and enjoyâ€¦
